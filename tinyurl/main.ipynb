    "## Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given a URL, system should generate a shorter and unique alias of it. This link should be short enough to be easily copied and pasted into applications.\n",
    "2. When users access a short link, our service should redirect them to the original link.\n",
    "3. Users should optionally be able to pick a custom short link for their URL.\n",
    "4. Links will expire after a standard default timespan, which users should be able to specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Highly available\n",
    "2. Real-time response\n",
    "3. Shortened links should not be guessable\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extended Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analytics\n",
    "2. Open REST APIs"

    "Our goal is to generate a shortended URL.\n",

    "## Encoding Actual URL\n",
    "\n",
    "It is straightforward to encode original URL using a hash function (e.g., MD5 or SHA256). The encoding could be base36(\\[a-z, 0-9\\]) or base62(\\[A-Z, a-z, 0-9\\]) and if we add '+' and '/' we can use Base64 encoding. Afterwards, we have to determine the length of the short key.\n",

    "With 68.7B unique strings, it is suffice for our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If users enter the same URL, they should not receive the same shortended URL.\n",
    "2. What if parts of the URL are URL-encoded?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workaround\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Appending a sequence number\n",
    "    - Might cause overflow\n",
    "    - Slows down the performance\n",
    "2. Append user ID\n",
    "    - User might be anynomous\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Generating Keys Offline\n",
    "\n",
    "We can have a standalone **Key Generation Service (KGS)** to generate random six-letter strings beforehand and stores them in a database (key-DB).\n",

    "1. Can concurrency cause problems?\n",
