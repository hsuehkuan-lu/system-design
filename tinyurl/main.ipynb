    "\n",
    "Before designing the system, the requirements should be clarified clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given a URL, system should generate a shorter and unique alias of it. This link should be short enough to be easily copied and pasted into applications.\n",
    "2. When users access a short link, our service should redirect them to the original link.\n",
    "3. Users should optionally be able to pick a custom short link for their URL.\n",
    "4. Links will expire after a standard default timespan, which users should be able to specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Highly available\n",
    "2. Real-time response\n",
    "3. Shortened links should not be guessable\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extended Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analytics\n",
    "2. Open REST APIs"

    "\n",
    "## Traffic Estimates\n",
